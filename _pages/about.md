I am a physicist with a keen interest in studying complex systems through the interplay between physics and artificial intelligence (AI). As a PhD candidate in biophysics at the University of Maryland, College Park, my research focuses on advancing the frontiers of artificial intelligence (AI) powered scientific analysis tools, with a particular focus on unraveling the intricate dynamics of complex systems. The advent of AI techniques has ushered in a paradigm shift in scientific discovery, revolutionizing our ability to automatically extract valuable insights from high-dimensional experimental and simulation data. Building upon these advancements, I integrate principles from physics into AI, bolstering the reliability and interpretability of AI-based scientific discovery methods. By harnessing the synergy between physics and AI, my primary objective is to reveal the underlying principles that govern biomolecules. The knowledge gained from this research will pave the way for the design of molecules and materials that exhibit desired emergent properties, offering immense potential in fields such as drug discovery, bioengineering, and material science.

In my free time, I enjoy practicing Chinese calligraphy, Taiji, running, and swimming. These hobbies allow me to stay active and creative, and I find that they complement my research by helping me maintain a healthy work-life balance. I believe that a well-rounded lifestyle is crucial for achieving success in both my personal and professional life.
