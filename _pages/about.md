I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Genentech co-advised by Dr. Kangway V. Chuang and Dr. Joachim Rudolph. I earned my PhD degree in biophysics in University of Maryland, College Park, supervised by Dr. Pratyush Tiwary, and obtained my bachelor's degree in physics from Peking University in China. During my PhD, I focused on combining physics and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to understand complex biophysical systems. My current research interests involve incorporating domain knowledge to design next generation AI powered scientific analysis tools for drug discovery. [*Read more about my research*](/research/)

In my free time, I enjoy practicing Chinese calligraphy, Taiji, running, cooking, etc. 

***Fun fact:** My Chinese friends often tease me, saying "You have the same hobbies as my grandpa!".*
