I am a physicist with a keen interest in studying complex systems through the interplay between physics and artificial intelligence (AI). As a graduate student in biophysics at the University of Maryland, College Park, my research focuses on using ideas from physics to guide the design of AI methods that can learn meaningful representations for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and biophysical experiments in general. These methods help accelerate MD simulations of biomolecular systems that would otherwise be prohibitively slow and contribute to a better understanding of the vast amount of data generated in MD simulations and biophysical experiments. Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between physics and AI to facilitate progress in studying complex biological systems.

In my free time, I enjoy practicing Chinese calligraphy, Taiji, running, and swimming. These hobbies allow me to stay active and creative, and I find that they complement my research by helping me maintain a healthy work-life balance. I believe that a well-rounded lifestyle is crucial for achieving success in both my personal and professional life.
